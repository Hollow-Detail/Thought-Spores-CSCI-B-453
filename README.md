# Thought Spores
 An interactive exploration of peculiar thought patterns floating in this reality.
 Made in Godot Engine.

Explore and interact with thoughts like bubbles, each with their own unique behaviors when your thought bubble is around them or when they are around you(in huge numbers ><). 
Just don't let massive, scary thoughts split yours into itty-bitty pieces.
